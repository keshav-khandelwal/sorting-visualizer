# 🚀 Sorting Visualizer

An interactive web application built with **React.js** that visually demonstrates popular sorting algorithms — ideal for mastering DSA concepts and frontend skills.

> ✨ Created with ❤️ by **Keshav Khandelwal**

## 🎯 Features

- 🔢 **Sorting Algorithms Implemented:**
  - 🫧 Bubble Sort
  - 📥 Selection Sort
  - 🔀 Merge Sort

- 🧠 **User Input**: Enter your own comma-separated numbers
- 🎛️ **Speed Control**: Adjust sorting animation speed
- 🎨 **Responsive UI**: Neumorphic, elegant interface with smooth transitions
- 🎥 **Visual Feedback**: Real-time animated swaps and comparisons

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tech       | Description                 |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| React.js   | Frontend Framework           |
| JavaScript | Algorithm & Animation Logic |
| CSS3       | Styling with Neumorphism     |
| HTML5      | Structure                    |

## 🧩 How It Works

Each algorithm pushes steps into an animation array:
- 🎨 Color change for comparisons
- 🔄 Swap animation (if needed)
- ✅ Final sorted elements marked in green

These animations are then **executed using `setTimeout`** to simulate sorting in action.

---
✅ To Do / Future Enhancements
 Add Quick Sort and Heap Sort

 Add Pause/Resume feature

 Display time and space complexity

 Add dark mode

 Include step counter and comparison counter

💡 Learning Objectives
Strengthened understanding of DSA through hands-on implementation.

Applied React state management and DOM manipulation techniques.

Gained experience in creating interactive UIs and reusable components.
